# InvestWhere API Backend

This service is designed for deployment on **AWS Lambda** using Zappa, and includes API Gateway authorization through Firebase Authentication with JWT _(JSON Web Tokens)_ .

## Flow and Architecture 

Here is a architecture diagram for the Lambda flow.
1. Usert invokes an API Gateway endpoint, including a Firebase JWT token in the `Authorization` header.
2. AWS's API Gateway invokes our Lambda Authorizer, which is our [firebase_authorizer.py](https://github.com/UdhayaShan1/investwhere-backend/blob/master/authorizer-package/firebase_authorizer.py).
3. The Lambda Authorizer decodes and verifies the JWT using Firebaseâ€™s public keys.
4. If unauthorized, error is thrown
5. If authorized, API Gateway forwards the request to the target endpoint (such as another Lambda function running the Flask app).

## Deploying to AWS Lambda

Highly recommended to [start by setting up your AWS credentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCHOsMPbcV0&ab_channel=BeABetterDev)

### Flask API

1. Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/UdhayaShan1/investwhere-backend.git`
2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate # On Powershell/VS Code
    ```
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create .env file with OPENAI_API_KEY as needed 
5. Run zappa commands and deploy `zappa deploy dev`

However you likely may want to create your own config so delete `zappa_settings.json` and run `zappa init` first.

### Authorizer
1. Copy `serviceAccountKey.json` from Firebase into `authorizer-package` folder. This is important for JWT verification as it stores your private keys.
2. In File Explorer, zip all the contents in `authorizer-package`
3. Create a AWS Lambda functions and upload this zip file.
4. Change the handler to `firebase_authorizer.lambda_handler`
5. Create new Authorizer in API Gateway and use Header for Identity source type. 
6. Attach this authorizer to your APIs and redeploy API.

## Request Example
Ensure Authorization is added in header with Value `Bearer ${token}`
